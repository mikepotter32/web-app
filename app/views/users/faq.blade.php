      <h1> How can I change the information in my profile? </h1>
      <p> It is your responsibility to keep the information in your profile up-to-date. You should
        especially ensure that your email address is kepy current. You can alter any of the fields
        in your profile, except your username. Once you have registered your username, it becomes
        yours for life. In extreme circumstances, you may request that the administrator change
        your username, but he or she will require a very good reason to do so. </p>
